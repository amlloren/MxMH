# Music & Mental Health

## Project Overview

This project is divided into 3 Major tasks:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Analysis
3. Data Visualization

## Data Cleaning

### Interpreting data

#### Block 0: Background
Respondents answer generic questions focused on musical background and listening habits.

#### Block 1: Music Genres
Respondents rank how often they listen to 16 music genres, where they can select:
* Never
* Rarely
* Sometimes
* Very frequently

#### Block 2: Mental Health
Respondents rank Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD on a scale of 0 to 10, where:
* 0 - I do not experience this.
* 10 - I experience this regularly, constantly/or to an extreme.

Additional data that does not fall in these blocks may provide useful background information. See column descriptors.

## Data Analysis


## Data Visualization



## Context
Music therapy, or MT, is the use of music to improve an individual's stress, mood, and overall mental health. MT is also recognized as an evidence-based practice, using music as a catalyst for "happy" hormones such as oxytocin.

However, MT employs a wide range of different genres, varying from one organization to the next.

The MxMH dataset aims to identify what, if any, correlations exist between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health. Ideally, these findings could contribute to a more informed application of MT or simply provide interesting sights about the mind.

### Data collection
Data collection was managed by @catherinerasgaitis via a Google Form. Respondents were not restricted by age or location. The form was posted in various Reddit forums, Discord servers, and social media platforms. Posters and "business cards" were also used to advertise the form in libraries, parks, and other public locations. The form was relatively brief so that respondents would be more likely finish the survey. "Harder" questions (such as BPM) were left optional for the same reason.

# ROUGH IDEAS:

1. Instrumentalists vs. Composers: Effects of Music on Mental Well-being
* Compare the self-reported effects of music (Music effects) between those who said "Yes" in the Instrumentalist and Composer columns.
* Use proportions of responses like "Improve" and "No effect" to understand the trends.

2. Genres and Mental Health Symptoms
* Analyze the frequency of listening to different genres (Frequency [Genre] columns).
* Compare this with the levels of mental health symptoms (Anxiety, Depression, OCD, Insomnia).
* Use correlation or group averages to identify genres linked to higher or lower levels of symptoms.

3. Age vs. Hours Per Day
* Group the data by age and calculate the average number of hours spent listening to music daily.
* Identify which age groups listen to music the most.

4. Improved Mood vs. Hours Per Day
* Group the data by Hours per day and analyze the proportions of "Improve" in the Music effects column.
* Visualize trends to determine if increased listening hours are linked to improved mood.
